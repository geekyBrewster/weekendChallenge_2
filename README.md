# Calculator Application

Welcome to your second weekend challenge!

**We are going to be building a calculator application using jQuery, Node, and Express!!**

Tasks
[x] Build 2 input fields and buttons for mathematical operators
[x] Accept input from the user: 2 numbers as inputs, math operator by button
[x] Convert input into an array like { x: 3, y: 4, type: "Add" }
[x] Send data object to the server side via an AJAX POST request
[x] Built logic on server side to compute the math using the user's numbers
[x] After calculation, the answer should be sent back to the client
[x] Display the answer on the DOM
[x] Finally, build a 'clear' button that resets the whole experience.

__HARD MODE:__
[ ] Convert input fields to Buttons 1-9
[ ] Build an equal button that sends all of the information to the server.
[ ] Construct data object to send to the server
[ ] Use existing calculation function to find the answer
[ ] Display the answer on the DOM

__PRO MODE:__
[ ] Create a delay from when the client receives the response from the Server, and when the calculation is actually displayed on the DOM.
[ ] The delay should be 3 seconds.
[ ] During that delay, show information that says 'computing' until the 3 second delay has finished
[ ] then remove the 'computing' message while showing the calculation.
